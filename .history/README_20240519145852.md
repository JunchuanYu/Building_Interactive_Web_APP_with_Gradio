# Building Interactive Web Apps with Gradio

This open-source Python tutorial will guide you in quickly building demos or web applications with Gradio. You'll start by setting up your Python environment and end with deploying interactive apps. Learn to make interfaces for text and images, improve user experience with layout customization, and manage complex interactions.

The course will also cover processing remote sensing data with Gradio and GDAL for tasks like image enhancement and slope analysis. You'll discover how to create interactive maps with Gradio and Foliumap, enabling dynamic geospatial data visualization.

Designed to equip you with the skills to integrate machine learning models and deploy your apps on Hugging Face Spaces, the course includes practical examples, demos, and assignments. By completing the tutorial, you'll be able to build, deploy, and share interactive web applications confidently and efficiently.

### Installation

**Prerequisite**: Gradio requires [Python 3.8 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


We recommend installing Gradio using `pip`, which is included by default in Python. Run this in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install gradio
```
