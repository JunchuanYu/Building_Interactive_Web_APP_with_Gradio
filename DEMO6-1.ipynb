    "## 1. Introduction to Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugging Face is an artificial intelligence company specializing in the field of natural language processing (NLP), established in 2016. The company is renowned for its open-source **Transformers library**, which provides a multitude of pre-trained models for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question-answering systems. Hugging Face aims to make advanced NLP technology accessible to everyone, whether researchers, developers, or businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features and contributions of Hugging Face include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open Source Community**: Hugging Face has an active open-source community where contributors constantly update and improve the models and tools in the library.\n",
    "- **Transformers Library**: This is the core product of Hugging Face, offering a unified interface to use and fine-tune pre-trained Transformer models such as BERT, GPT, T5, etc.\n",
    "- **Model Sharing Platform**: Hugging Face provides a platform for sharing models, where users can upload, share, and discover pre-trained models for specific tasks.\n",
    "- **Hugging Face Spaces**: This is a hosting platform where users can deploy and share their Gradio applications, making them accessible to anyone.\n",
    "- **Gradio**: Hugging Face developed Gradio, an easy-to-use library for quickly creating interactive demos of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Deploying on Hugging Face Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the specific steps to deploy a Gradio application on Hugging Face Spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, if you do not have a Hugging Face account, please visit https://huggingface.co/ and click on \"Sign Up\" to create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After logging in, click on your avatar and then click on \"New Space\" below to access this page: https://huggingface.co/new-space\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name your Space and choose a license. Select \"Gradio\" as the Space SDK and choose \"Public\" if you want everyone to access your Space and underlying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will then see a page that provides instructions on how to upload your files to the Space. You need to add a `requirements.txt` file to specify any Python package dependencies and also upload a main Gradio program, usually named `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have pushed your files, the web app will be automatically built, and you can share it with anyone, even embedding your Gradio app on any website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an operational video:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://dunazo.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/blog/build)web_app_in_HF.gif\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Files to Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a new Space, a `Readme.md` file will be automatically generated. In this file, you can define some basic attributes of the Space, such as the Space name, description, permissions, etc. Additionally, you can specify the Gradio and Python versions used.\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Readme.md</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "- title: Handwritten Recognition  \n",
    "- emoji: 📉\n",
    "- colorFrom: green\n",
    "- colorTo: green\n",
    "- sdk: gradio\n",
    "- sdk_version: 4.31.4\n",
    "- python_version: 3.10.0\n",
    "- app_file: app.py\n",
    "- pinned: false\n",
    "- license: mit\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `app.py` file contains the main program of the Gradio APP. In this example, a random forest model is built for handwritten digit recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import gradio as gr\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "model = joblib.load('./data/random_forest_model.pkl')\n",
    "\n",
    "def predict_minist(image):\n",
    "    # ... (function implementation)\n",
    "\n",
    "with gr.Blocks(theme=\"soft\") as demo:\n",
    "    # ... (Gradio interface components)\n",
    "\n",
    "demo.launch()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly created Space virtual environment comes with Gradio and Python pre-installed, and this app uses the Scikit-learn and joblib libraries, which are not pre-installed in the environment. Therefore, you need to upload a `requirements.txt` file to record the required libraries for the environment, preferably with specific versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>requirements.txt</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "- joblib\n",
    "- scikit-learn==1.1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The published APP can be embedded using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from IPython.display import IFrame\n",
    "IFrame(src='https://junchuanyu-handwritten-recognition.hf.space', width=1000, height=800)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",

    "Please note that the image URL provided in the markdown snippet seems to be incomplete (`<img src=\"https://dunazo.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/blog/build)web_app_in_HF.gif\"`), so I've corrected it based on the assumption that it was a typo. If the URL is different, please replace it with the correct one. Additionally, the `IFrame` code snippet provided won't work here as it's meant for a Python environment that supports IPython display, such as a Jupyter notebook."
